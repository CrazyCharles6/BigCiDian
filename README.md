# BigCiDian

## Goal
This project is an attempt to create a pronunciation lexicon covering both English and Chinese words *in a unified phoneset* for ASR applications.  

P.S. "CiDian" means "lexicon" in Chinese.

### Phoneset
The unified phoneset should be a simple and complementary IPA subset that covers both languages.

### English Source
English entries are extracted from CMU dict.

### Chinese Source
Chinese entries are extracted from DaCiDian project that primarily deals with Chinese words.
